"Usage: flash [OPTIONS] MATES_1.FASTQ MATES_2.FASTQ\n"
"\n"
"DESCRIPTION:\n"
"\n"
"FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads) is an accurate and fast tool\n"
"to merge paired-end reads that were generated from DNA fragments whose\n"
"lengths are shorter than twice the length of reads.  Merged read pairs result\n"
"in unpaired longer reads.  Longer reads are generally more desired in genome\n"
"assembly and genome analysis processes.\n"
"\n"
"FLASH cannot merge paired-end reads that do not overlap.  It also cannot merge\n"
"jumping read pairs that have an outward orientation (but these reads tend not\n"
"to overlap anyway).  FLASH also is not designed for data that has a\n"
"significant portion of indel errors (such as Sanger sequencing data).\n"
"\n"
"MANDATORY INPUT:\n"
"\n"
"To run FLASH, you may provide two FASTQ files of paired-end reads\n"
"where corresponding paired reads are in the same order in both files.\n"
"Alternatively, you may provide one FASTQ file, which may be standard input,\n"
"containing interleaved paired-end reads (see the --interleaved option).\n"
"The input FASTQ files may be either plain-text or compressed with gzip.\n"
"Other compression formats for the input files are not yet supported.\n"
"\n"
"OUTPUT:\n"
"\n"
"The default output of FLASH is a FASTQ file containing the extended fragments\n"
"produced by combining read pairs, two FASTQ files containing read pairs\n"
"that were not combined, and histogram files that show the distribution of\n"
"lengths of the extended fragments.  Writing the uncombined read pairs to an\n"
"interleaved FASTQ file is also supported.  Also, writing the extended\n"
"fragments directly to standard output is supported.  Plain-text and gzip\n"
"output formats are natively supported; other output formats are supported\n"
"indirectly via the --compress-prog option.  (Note that this is all FASTQ.)\n"
"\n"
"OPTIONS:\n"
"\n"
"  -m, --min-overlap=NUM   The minimum required overlap length between two\n"
"                          reads to provide a confident overlap.  Default:\n"
"                          10bp.\n"
"\n"
"  -M, --max-overlap=NUM   Maximum overlap length expected in approximately\n"
"                          90% of read pairs.  It is by default set to 70bp,\n"
"                          which works well for 100bp reads generated from a\n"
"                          180bp library, assuming a normal distribution of\n"
"                          fragment lengths.  Overlaps longer than the maximum\n"
"                          overlap parameter are still considered as good\n"
"                          overlaps, but the mismatch density (explained below)\n"
"                          is calculated over the first max_overlap bases in\n"
"                          the overlapped region rather than the entire\n"
"                          overlap.  Default: 70bp, or calculated from the\n"
"                          specified read length, fragment length, and fragment\n"
"                          length standard deviation.\n"
"\n"
"  -x, --max-mismatch-density=NUM\n"
"                          Maximum allowed ratio between the number of\n"
"                          mismatched base pairs and the overlap length.\n"
"                          Two reads will not be combined with a given overlap\n"
"                          if that overlap results in a mismatched base density\n"
"                          higher than this value.  Note: Any occurence of an\n"
"                          'N' in either read is ignored and not counted\n"
"                          towards the mismatches or overlap length.  Our\n"
"                          experimental results suggest that higher values of\n"
"                          the maximum mismatch density yield larger\n"
"                          numbers of correctly merged read pairs but at\n"
"                          the expense of higher numbers of incorrectly\n"
"                          merged read pairs.  Default: 0.25.\n"

"                          and -s 18, so this works out to a maximum overlap of\n"
